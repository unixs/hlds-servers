Double Strife

Somewhere there in the desert, the Black Mesa facility has their weapon testing polygon. 
Nothing too fancy – few buildings, a channel, power generator and a bunker… Just in case. 
The team dispatched there was calling it with the codename “Double Strife”.
Before the cascade the polygon was used for wargames for Black Mesa secure team and the H.E.C.U. team. 
This was the case during the cascade as well, and the employees involved in the war game had no idea what was happening in the facility.
Just another day at the polygon, training from dusk till dawn… 

All that changed when the siren started. None knew about the nuke contingency plan, 
none knew that the nuclear strike can be triggered from the bunker on this polygon… None but one unnamed soldier…

Somewhere there a loud blast was heard, and mushroom cloud towered the sky, trying to reach the setting sun.
